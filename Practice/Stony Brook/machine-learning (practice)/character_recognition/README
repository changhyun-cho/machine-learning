This example is inspired from "Make your own Neural Network" by Tariq
Rashid, using the notation from Franklin.

Some diffs w/ Franklin:

 -- we use back-propagation to get the errors at on the hidden layer

 -- we set alpha = 1 -- the intent is that you come in with x in [0, 1]

 -- we initialize the matricies with Gaussian normal random numbers
    with a width mu = 1/sqrt(n), where n is the size of the input
    vector.

 -- we don't offset the output from the hidden layer to shift it into
    [-0.5, 0.5]
